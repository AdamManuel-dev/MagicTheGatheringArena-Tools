# GA launch plan
Purpose: outline GA launch activities, documentation, tracing/evals, and profile feature toggles.

## Pre-GA hardening
- Final security audit (static analysis, dependency review) completed with sign-off
- Mastra tracing hooks integrated with CLI lifecycle and evaluated for performance impact
- Profile management subsystem tested for multi-user defaults and migration paths

## Documentation deliverables
- Finalized setup guide, troubleshooting, analytics usage guide, LLM workflow handbook
- Provider configuration best practices and credential rotation procedures published
- GA release notes capturing tracing, profiling, advanced features, and known issues
- Operational runbook covering monitoring, alert response, backup procedures, disaster recovery drill

## Observability and evaluations
- Tracing/evals API persisting Mastra runs with retention policy and dashboard access
- Evaluation harness thresholds tuned and regression automation integrated into CI
- Telemetry dashboards tracking TTFI, legality rate, opponent summary validity with alerting

## Rollout mechanics
- Feature flags for tracing, telemetry, and profile toggles configured with rollback paths
- Release channel automation promoting Beta builds to Stable after checklist approval
- Support training completed with FAQ updates and escalation paths defined

## Post-launch governance
- Schedule post-GA retrospective (within 30 days) to review success metrics and backlog gaps
- Maintain COMPLETED_TODOS.md and implementation-log.md with GA completion references
- Capture lessons learned into roadmap planning for post-GA enhancements
