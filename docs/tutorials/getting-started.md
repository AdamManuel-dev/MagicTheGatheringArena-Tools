# Getting started
Purpose: give newcomers a first success exporting their MTG Arena collection on macOS.

**You will build:** A local CSV of your owned cards generated by the CLI.
**Time:** 30 minutes
**You will learn:** Installing the CLI, enabling Arena logs, running `collection:export`.

## Before we begin
- Confirm Node.js 20.11.0 LTS or later is installed: `node --version`
- Enable "Detailed Logs (Plugin Support)" in MTG Arena and restart the client
- Locate your Arena logs at
  `~/Library/Logs/Wizards Of The Coast/MTGA/Player.log`

Look at the goal: a CSV file named `collection.csv` containing card names and counts.

## Step 1: install the CLI
Run these commands in a terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/you/MagicTheGatheringArenaScripts.git
cd MagicTheGatheringArenaScripts
npm install
npm run build
```

✓ Check: `./bin/run --version` prints the CLI version without errors.

## Step 2: export your collection
Run the export command and write it to a CSV file:
```bash
./bin/run collection:export --bulk --out collection.csv
```

✓ Check: `ls collection.csv` lists the file. Inspect a preview:
```bash
head -5 collection.csv
```
You should see column headers such as `arena_id` and `name` plus real card rows.

## Step 3: verify Scryfall enrichment
Confirm card names resolved correctly:
```bash
grep -n "Lightning Bolt" collection.csv || true
```
If you see known card names, bulk enrichment worked. If not, rerun without
`--bulk` to fall back to per-card lookups.

## What you accomplished
- Installed dependencies and built the CLI once
- Exported a complete CSV snapshot of your owned cards
- Verified Scryfall data enrichment on the exported file
